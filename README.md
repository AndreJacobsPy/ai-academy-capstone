# Student Success Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Introduction

In today's world, Higher Education can be the key to an impactful and
fulfilling career. Whether it is in a typical University setting or
other modern mediums.

Higher education institutions collect tons of data about their students
and their backgrounds. Our team believes in the potential of this data
and how it can be used to improve the student experience. Academic institutions
have a large impact on the lives of young people and deserve the chance 
to understand their students better. Through this better understanding
Universities will have guidance to help student who are in need. In many 
cases students who dropout are experiencing difficult circumstances and 
with the correct guidance and support they can be successful.

## Challenge

With around 40% of undergraduate student leaving universities and colleges
every year[^1], our team believes it is crucial that Higher Education institutions
do what they can to reverse this trend. On average students who do not graduate are
expected to earn $21,000 less than college graduates.

The data we will be using collects information about prior student experience, background
of students immediate family, demographic information, and basic economic indicators.
Our deliverable will help institutions to know their students better in regard to their
likely outcome and be able to provide resources to those in need of assistance, to counter 
high dropout rates.

## Prior Research

There has been a paper published[^2] using this same dataset. This paper was more 
focused on feature importance than predictions. They used Random Forests and XGBoost to find
feature importance. They found that *Curricular units 2nd sem (approved)* was the most
impactful feature. Their research also showed that Course a student was taking and Tuition
Fees up to date were relevant to a student's result.

In a second paper[^3], there was a more predictive focus on Dropout prediction. They used
Linear Discriminant Analysis for dimensionality reduction, as well as, Random Forest and 
Support Vector Machines for prediction. Their data included Gender, Age Range, Additional
Learning Requirements, and Course Credits. This paper used a Binary outcome for dropout.

This second paper uses High School data, which could have a different population but, 
their methods remain relevant. A large challenge that both of these studies neglected was the
appearance of fields in the data that could bias a model used in production. Features such as
Nationality, Gender, Age, and background of parents could make model discriminant.
