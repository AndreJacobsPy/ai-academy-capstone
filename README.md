# Student Success Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Introduction

In today's world, Higher Education can be the key to an impactful and
fulfilling career. Whether it is in a typical University setting or
other modern mediums.

Higher education institutions collect tons of data about their students
and their backgrounds. Our team believes in the potential of this data
and how it can be used to improve the student experience. Academic institutions
have a large impact on the lives of young people and deserve the chance 
to understand their students better. Through this better understanding
Universities will have guidance to help student who are in need. In many 
cases students who dropout are experiencing difficult circumstances and 
with the correct guidance and support they can be successful.

## Challenge

With around 40% of undergraduate student leaving universities and colleges
every year[^1], our team believes it is crucial that Higher Education institutions
do what they can to reverse this trend.
